# Terms of Service for Marcia OS
**Last Updated: February 2026**

By using Marcia OS you agree to these terms. Marcia is a private, owner-operated bot and is not intended for public installation or third-party hosting.

### 1. User Requirements
* You must comply with the **Discord Terms of Service** and **Community Guidelines**, including age requirements.
* The owner is responsible for configuring channels, roles, and permissions so the bot can operate safely.

### 2. Acceptable Use
* **No exploitation:** Do not spam commands, farm XP with scripts, or tamper with timers/cooldowns.
* **No harassment:** Fish-Link DMs and event pings may not be used to bully, threaten, or dox anyone.
* **No self-bots/automation:** Interact with Marcia through standard Discord clients only.
* **Security:** Do not attempt to access other servers’ data, reverse engineer database files, or scrape telemetry.

### 3. Data Integrity & Persistence
* Marcia stores server-specific data (settings, XP, inventory, trade listings, command usage counts) in `data/marcia_os.db`.
* Database migrations may run on startup to preserve historical data; do not delete or move the database while the bot is running.
* The owner is responsible for backing up server data.

### 4. Service Availability
* Marcia OS is provided **“as is.”** Outages, missed reminders, or lost progress may occur.
* Admins may pause or remove features (e.g., leveling, Fish-Link) at their discretion for server safety.

### 5. Moderation & Enforcement
* The owner may reset XP, remove listings, or restrict access for users who break these terms.
* Severe abuse (raiding, phishing, malware) will be reported to Discord Trust & Safety.

### 6. Limitation of Liability
The developers and server operators are not liable for any damages arising from your use of Marcia OS, including data loss or interactions with other users through Fish-Link, event pings, trading, or analytics dashboards.
