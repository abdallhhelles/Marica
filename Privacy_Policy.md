# Privacy Policy for Marcia OS
**Last Updated: December 2025**

Marcia OS ("the Application") is a tool designed for the Helles Hub community. This policy explains what data we collect and how it is used.

### 1. Data We Collect
To provide leveling, trading, and translation features, we collect:
* **User IDs:** To track XP, levels, and inventory.
* **Fish-Link Data:** We store which fish you own ("Extra") and which you need ("Wanted") to provide matching services.
* **Message Metadata:** Timestamps are used to enforce a 60-second XP cooldown.
* **Translation Content:** When you react with a flag, the message text is briefly processed to provide a translation.

### 2. How We Use Data
* **Leveling:** Your XP determines your rank in the Alliance.
* **Matchmaking:** When a match is found in the Fish-Link Network, we use your ID to send an automated Direct Message (DM).
* **Translations:** We use the Google Translate API to decode messages. We do not store these translations permanently.

### 3. Data Storage & Deletion
* **Storage:** Data is stored in private JSON files (`levels.json`, `fish_data.json`) on a secure private server.
* **Deletion:** You can remove your trading data via the "Manage My Trades" button. To wipe your leveling data, contact a Hub Administrator. If the bot is removed from a server, server-specific configuration is deleted.

### 4. Third-Party Sharing
We **never** sell your data. We only share message text with Google Translate for the "Flag Reaction" feature.
